# CL-PRIORITY-QUEUES

Note: *This is not yet released*

This is an implementation of [CDR-13][cdr-13]: Priority Queues for
Common Lisp.  If you need this functionality, you can find most of
it in the excellent library [CL-HEAP][cl-heap].  However, `CL-HEAP`
does not quiet conform to the CDR-13 specification and is distributed
under a more restrictive license than this library.
